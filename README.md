## SustainAI - Automated Recycling Classification

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project on automated recycling classification. The project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify waste items into different categories, such as paper, plastic, metal, leaf waste, and wood waste.

The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Data preparation and visualization:** This part involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, as well as visualizing the data to understand its distribution and characteristics.
2. **Model building and evaluation:** This part involves building and evaluating different machine learning models to find the one that performs best on the dataset.

The code for the project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

The code is organized into the following Jupyter notebooks:

* **Data_Visualization.ipynb & Augmenting+Resizing Data.ipynb:** These notebooks contain the code for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, as well as visualizing the data.
* **training.ipynb** Contains the model built using transfer learning approach and the resulting curves and classification report.
To run the code, simply download the repository and open the Jupyter notebooks in your browser.

### Documentation

The documentation for the project is located in the `Documentation` folder. The documentation includes information on the following topics:

* **Dataset:** A description of the dataset used for the project.
* **Data preparation and visualization:** A detailed explanation of the data preparation and visualization steps.
* **Model building and evaluation:** A detailed explanation of the model building and evaluation process.
* 
### Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Usage

To run the code, simply download the repository and open the Jupyter notebooks in your browser, using anaconda prompt.
You can also access the mobile application from releases.
